# Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres

----
For this project, I'll be focusing on data modeling and building an ETL pipeline that transfers data into tables from files using Python and SQL as well as building fact and dimension tables using the STAR schema with a focus on making the data ready for analytics.

The project is due Monday, May 11, 2020 and by then this repo will contain all of my work as well as an updated readme. Thanks for stopping by!
